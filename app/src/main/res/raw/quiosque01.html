		<h2>Diskette</h2>
		A floppy disk, also called a diskette or just disk, is a type of disk <img src=diskette.jpg hspace=1 vspace=1 align=right>storage composed of a disk of thin and flexible magnetic storage medium, sealed in a rectangular plastic carrier lined with fabric that removes dust particles. Floppy disks are read and written by a floppy disk drive (FDD).


		<h2 align=right>Motherboard</h2>
		A motherboard (sometimes alternatively known as the mainboard, system <img src=motherboard.jpg  hspace=1 vspace=1 align=left>board, planar board or logic board,[1] or colloquially, a mobo) is the main printed circuit board (PCB) found in computers and other expandable systems. It holds and allows communication between many of the crucial electronic components of a system, such as the central processing unit (CPU) and memory, and provides connectors for other peripherals. Unlike a backplane, a motherboard contains significant sub-systems such as the processor and other components.


		<h2>keyboard</h2>
		In computing, a computer keyboard is a typewriter-style device, which <img src=keyboard.jpg  hspace=1 vspace=1 align=right>uses an arrangement of buttons or keys, to act as mechanical levers or electronic switches. Following the decline of punch cards and paper tape, interaction via teleprinter-style keyboards became the main input device for computers.

		A keyboard typically has characters engraved or printed on the keys and each press of a key typically corresponds to a single written symbol. However, to produce some symbols requires pressing and holding several keys simultaneously or in sequence. While most keyboard keys produce letters, numbers or signs (characters), other keys or simultaneous key presses can produce actions or execute computer commands.
