		<h2>Mouse</h2>
		In computing, a mouse is a pointing device that detects two-dimensional<img src=mouse.jpg  hspace=1 vspace=1 align=right> motion relative to a surface. This motion is typically translated into the motion of a pointer on a display, which allows for fine control of a graphical user interface.

		Physically, a mouse consists of an object held in one's hand, with one or more buttons. Mice often also feature other elements, such as touch surfaces and "wheels", which enable additional control and dimensional input.


		<h2 align=right>Hard Drive</h2>
		A hard disk drive (HDD), hard disk, hard drive or fixed disk[b] is a data<img src=harddrive.jpg  hspace=1 vspace=1 align=left> storage device used for storing and retrieving digital information using one or more rigid ("hard") rapidly rotating disks (platters) coated with magnetic material. The platters are paired with magnetic heads arranged on a moving actuator arm, which read and write data to the platter surfaces.[2] Data is accessed in a random-access manner, meaning that individual blocks of data can be stored or retrieved in any order rather than sequentially. HDDs retain stored data even when powered off.


		<h2>ISA Interface</h2>
		Industry Standard Architecture (ISA) is a retronym term for the 16-bit <img src=isa.jpg  hspace=1 vspace=1 align=right>internal bus of IBM PC/AT and similar computers based on the Intel 80286 and its immediate successors during the 1980s. The bus was (largely) backward compatible with the 8-bit bus of the 8088-based IBM PC, including the IBM PC/XT as well as IBM PC compatibles.

		Originally referred to as the PC/AT-bus it was also termed I/O Channel by IBM. The ISA concept was coined by competing PC-clone manufacturers in the late 1980s or early 1990s as a reaction to IBM attempts to replace the AT-bus with its new and incompatible Micro Channel architecture.
